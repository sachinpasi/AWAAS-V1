                We were first time home buyers in need of a house before our
                apartment lease expired in a month. We found Awaasonline from a
                referral of a friend. The amount of time they had spent in
                helping us make our own informative decisions is praiseworthy.

                We moved from a different state to Panipat and Awaasonline did
                an amazing job in helping us choose a neighborhood and the right
                house for us. Theyâ€™re very knowledgeable about the different
                neighborhoods in Panipat. They were very responsive to all of
                our questions.

                Awaasonline are ultimate real estate professionals. They were
                well informed, patient and receptive. They were able to walk us
                through every aspect of buying a home. Their expertise made it
                so much easier to focus on the actual move. I would highly
                recommend their services to anyone looking for a realtor.

                Awaasonline has been helping me with my house purchase. I've
                found their service excellent, they are professional, so
                helpful. From my experience, they always seem to put their
                customers first. I would definitely recommend them to all home
                buyers.

                Awaasonline was a great realtor company with a great team. They
                listened to our needs and found us a house in our budget in a
                great location. A few of my family members have used them as
                well and you will not be disappointed with their service and
                quality.
